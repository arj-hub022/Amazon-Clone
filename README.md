# Amazon-Clone

This is a basic Amazon Clone built using only HTML and CSS. The project focuses on replicating the frontend design and layout of Amazon’s homepage and product UI. It's fully responsive and visually structured to give the feel of a real e-commerce platform.

🚀 Features:
✅ Static layout inspired by Amazon

📱 Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

🖼️ Product sections, banners, navigation bar, and footer

🎨 Built with clean, reusable HTML and CSS code

🛠️ Tech Stack:
